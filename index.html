      <p>We are a student run club at Dublin High School. Our mission is to help as many people as we can learn more about arithmetic and how it applies to the real world. We will have interactive projects that can and WILL engage anyone who wants to learn more about math. We provide a calm and fun enviornemnt where students can share ideas and learn more about, as stated by the name, different mathematical tips and tricks that can be applied to solve real world problems.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>The Math Tips and Tricks club(not to get mixed with the math club) is a club oriented to provide students with stratagem concerning tests and exams that they will further endeavor in their math career. The club will also provide students with short-cuts catered for standardized tests such as the SAT, ACT, and PSAT in order to improve the future of our fellow Gaels. In addition to Tips and Tricks, we will give students a foundation on how to maintain accuracy while remaining within the time constraints of that specific test. With these newly developed skills, students will receive the basic understandings necessary to become a successful mathematician. In conclusion, MTT will help students get better at teaching and learning math.</p></li>

        <li><p>We want every student on campus to learn while having fun with us in our club. Our goal is to improve everybody’s skills in math, regardless of which math course they are taking. We want people to learn new concepts and tricks to help them accelerate their ability to do math to assist them in upper classes. We also want to improve their logical thinking. Word problems can be hard to comprehend in some cases. We will teach the students to learn different ways to understand and simplify word problems. We will also be doing homework collaboratively. Challenge problems will be given out throughout the course.</p></li>
